Full Chests
=========
Fixes the issues with Vanilla double chests and modded Minecraft (Currently Unstable)

Note: for those wishing to fork the project: You will need to add `-Dfml.coreMods.load=fullchests.asm.LoadingPlugin` to the VM options to get the ASM working, which is important as the whole thing is ASM
